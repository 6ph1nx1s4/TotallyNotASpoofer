## What is this?

This is a simple yet expansive spoofer for IL2CPP games using [MelonLoader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader). It spoofs a lot of details for Unity Games, Including [Steamworks.Net](https://steamworks.github.io/), [Unity Hardware Details](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/SystemInfo.html) and also prevents Steam from using [Authentication Tickets](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/auth) for some game authentication (Keep in mind this can break some games. Its recommended you fork this and edit to your needs)

## Why did I make this

Well to be honest. I made this due to the fact that a lot of unity games use these details to collect information and also *spy* on users in a way to get a basis on who plays their games. Personally I didnt like that.

This also helps to be unbanned from a game that uses some of these these for banning systems.

## How do I use this?

Well, Compile it from source and then when compiled throw it inside your plugins folder. And <b>BAM</b> everything is spoofed.
